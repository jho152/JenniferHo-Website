        </h1>
        <div class="subheading mb-5">English TeacherðŸ“š</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">Hi, my name is Jennifer Ho. I am an Asian American student. I graduated from Bolsa Grande High School, which earns my high school diploma. I am a first-year English major student; studying at the University of California, Riverside. Some of my skills include communication, organization, and time management.For example, I have done many community services that includes working with students and serving my community. My favorite volunteer event would be feeding the less fortunate individuals on Thanksgiving morning. It always bring me joy to help other people when they need it. I have been in a program called AVID, which stands for Advancement Via Individual Determination. I signed a contract with this organization for school since I was in seventh grade. I recently graduated from the club last year. This club helps young students, like me, figure out what colleges fits best for usâ€“mine being the University of California, Riverside- and helps us be organized and finish tasks in a timely manner.
<br><br>

        Following, I used do to a little bit of coding back in elementary school. I did a program which gave us rewards for the coding we did. I believe we did JAVA script. Additionally, I am also proficient with Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator. I graduated high school with cords from my Multi-Media Honors class, with the Adobe Photoshop certificate. Not only am I proficient with my photoshop and illustration skills, I also can be a good leader. I was the president of my club, VSAâ€“which stands for Vietnamese Student Association. I enjoyed leading this club. I managed meeting slides for both officers and club members. I make sure that the members enjoys the club as much as I do. I was able to use my communication skills and communicate with other schoolâ€™s VSA that was in different districts in order to expand my schoolâ€™s name and have my members make more connections with different districts rather than being restricted to only one district. 
<br><br>

        Continuing, I also help out with my mom at her nail salon. I help stand at the reception desk and take phone calls and help with the cashier task. This skill takes communication and customer service skills very well. In my free time I enjoy reading booksâ€“whether its fiction or nonfiction. I mainly enjoy fiction. I also write poetry sometimesâ€“I mainly write nonfiction poetry, but from time to time I also write fiction poetry. Since i am currently and English major, I hope to minor in business to obtain knowledge about the business world. Additionally, in my free time I love being around my family and friends. Something I love doing with my family and friends are eating! I am a huge fan of food so I try to explore new cuisines with my friends and family. One of my favorite cuisines is Vietnamese foodâ€“since it is also my own culture. Overall, I would describe myself as someone who is very bubbly and open to new experiences. Since I am open to new experiences, I am not afraid of most things.
